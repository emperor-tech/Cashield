# Auth System Fixes

This directory contains custom implementations to fix issues with the Laravel authentication system, particularly when non-string values are passed to the `auth()` helper function or `Auth::guard()` method.

## Files

### CustomAuthManager.php

This file extends Laravel's `AuthManager` class to add robust error handling and type checking for the `guard()` method. It ensures that:

1. Non-string guard names are properly handled and logged
2. Errors are caught and logged
3. A fallback guard is returned in case of errors

### CustomGuard.php

This file extends Laravel's `SessionGuard` class to add robust error handling for all authentication methods. It ensures that:

1. The guard can be instantiated even with invalid parameters
2. All methods (`user()`, `check()`, `guest()`, etc.) have proper error handling
3. Session-based authentication is used as a fallback

## Helper Functions

### safe_auth()

A safer version of the `auth()` helper function that:

1. Validates the guard name parameter
2. Handles errors gracefully
3. Returns a fallback guard in case of errors

### is_auth_working()

A utility function to check if the authentication system is working properly.

## Middleware

### AuthGuardProxy

This middleware intercepts auth-related errors and provides fallback behavior.

### InitializeAuthManager

This middleware ensures the auth system is properly initialized before the request is processed.

## Facade

### Auth

A custom facade that overrides Laravel's Auth facade to use our safe authentication methods.

## Usage

The system is designed to work transparently with existing code. No changes are needed to use these fixes.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. Check the logs for warnings or errors related to auth
2. Make sure you're passing string values to `auth()` and `Auth::guard()`
3. If you need to debug, use `is_auth_working()` to check if the auth system is functioning properly
